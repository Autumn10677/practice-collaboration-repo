# Welcome to "```math-utils```"

In this project, we will develop a handful of functions that are useful for basic mathematical operatures.

## About
As of now, we only intend to create functions for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing two numbers. We hope to make each of these functions follow "best practices" and make robust error handling.

## Quickstart
To run, make sure that ```math_utils.py``` is located in your script directory and run...

```
import math_utils

math_utils.add(1, 2)
```
