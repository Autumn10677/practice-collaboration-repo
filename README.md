# Welcome to "```math-utils```"

In this project, we will develop a handful of functions that are useful for basic mathematical operations. We will practice collaborative coding, following "best practices," setting up automated testing, and much more!

## About
For now, we only intend to create functions for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing two numbers.

## Quickstart
To run, make sure that ```math_utils.py``` is located in your script directory and run...

```
import math_utils

math_utils.add(1, 2)
```
